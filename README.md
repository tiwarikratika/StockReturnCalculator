# StockReturnCalculator

<p>I created this app Stock Returns Calculator using <b> Vanilla JS</b>
which basically tells how much profit/ loss i earned.
</p>

<p>It takes in input the price at which a person bought the stock, the quantity of stocks bought ad the current price of the stocl</p>

<p> It then returns the profit or the loss occurred in Rs and in percentage upto 2 places of decimal</p>
